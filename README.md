## Ruby Hashes

The Ruby Hash class implements a "data structure" that provides a
collection of key-value pairs. The keys are used to 'index', or find,
the value associated with the value.

### Demo
Create a file _simple_hash.rb_.   
Finished version is  _simple_hash_done.rb_

### Lab 
Write a program in the file _squares_hash.rb_ that:  
* Prompts the user for a minimum and maximum number.  
* Generates a Hash that has key-value pairs, or entries, where.    
	* Each key in a pair is a integer between the min and max entered.  
	* Each value in the pair is the square of key in that pair. But this value should be instance of String. 
* Show/print the hash generated.

### Lab
Modify _choose_state.rb_ to prompt and get a New England state code from the user. Then print out the name of the state.  

### Demo
Create a file _relative_contacts.rb_.   
Finished version is  _relative_contacts_done.rb_
